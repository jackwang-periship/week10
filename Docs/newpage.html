<h3>Canada - August 31, 2016</h3>
Canada Post is pleased to have reached tentative short-term agreements with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW). The agreements will avert a work disruption, bringing much-needed certainty in the postal system for our employees and customers. Canadians can now use the postal system with confidence. This is especially important as Canadian businesses large and small are already planning for the upcoming holiday shipping season. These agreements are for a period of two years, rather than the typical four-year contracts negotiated in the past. The issues facing the Corporation, with declining mail volumes and a growing pension obligation, are complex. This approach provides more time for thoughtful discussion and analysis on how to best address these issues without the ongoing threat of a work disruption. The agreements must be ratified by members.

The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) has provided Canada Post with 72-hour strike notices. This means the union will be in a legal position to commence strike action on August 28, 2016. Following that, they will be free to take further action to disrupt the postal service at any time without additional warning. Up until now, the union was required to provide advance notice of any disruptive job action. Unfortunately, as of August 28, 2016, that will no longer be the case. The union will not be required to provide any notice going forward. This action by the union does not necessarily mean a full-scale strike will occur. The Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, MaryAnn Mihychuk, announced she will appoint a special mediator to assist in negotiations with CUPW. Canada Post will fully cooperate in the process. The assistance of a neutral third party will help both parties address the real challenges facing the postal service caused by declining mail volumes and increasing pension obligations.

Our plan at IMEX will be to continue to receive and process our client's Canada-bound shipments.
